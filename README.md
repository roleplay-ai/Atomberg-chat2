## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend through the following API calls:

- **Initialize**: `GET /api/init`
- **Upload**: `POST /api/upload`
- **Chat**: `POST /api/chat`

The `next.config.js` file includes a rewrite rule to proxy API calls to the backend server.

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Customization

You can customize the chatbot by modifying:

- **Styles**: Edit `src/app/globals.css`
- **Components**: Modify `src/app/page.tsx`
- **API Endpoints**: Update `next.config.js`

## Deployment

To deploy the Next.js application:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

Or deploy to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or any hosting service that supports Next.js.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot connect to backend**: Make sure the backend server is running on port 5000
2. **API errors**: Check that the OpenAI API key is configured in the backend
3. **Build errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

### Development Tips

- The app uses TypeScript for better development experience
- All API calls are proxied through Next.js to avoid CORS issues
- The chat interface automatically handles loading states and errors
- Messages are stored in React state and persist during the session
